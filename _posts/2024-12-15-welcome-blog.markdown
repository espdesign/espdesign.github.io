### Yeah, I agree with you; bacon tastes good.

 But I went vegan many years ago, completely cold turkey. When asked how I stopped eating animal products, I usually describe it as trying to learn how to eat again. I don't try to convince people to follow the same difficult path; I only tell people it's a protest against factory farms and tell them that as long as they put effort into eating less meat, I'm happier for it. I view factory farms as a highly immoral system of food production. Some people argue that my viewpoint is one of privilege. I live in a country where I can decide to stop consuming animal products and still get the nutrition my body needs.

I must confess that I have not told you the whole truth. I am no longer a vegan. I consume some fish, eggs, and, in the past, some venison that fit my moral ideals. These animal products are always from somewhere I can point to, and I can guarantee they have not participated in our factory-farming food system. 

Even as I write these words, I struggle internally with my decision to eat these animal products because veganism has been such a core part of my life and who I am. It affects where I eat and what social events I attend. Being a vegan was my identity every waking day, and my food choices greatly impacted my life. And yet, I can only wonder what REAL vegans would think. 

No! I'm not like those other meat eaters,
Please don't hate me,
We have so much in common,
Veganism is a box that people put you in, a box you put yourself in; I can't escape no matter how aware I am.

Anyways, [the video that made me go cold turkey was a speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5hGQDLprA8) by Gary Yourofsky, an animal activist who is no longer active.

I will rewatch it; I may think differently about my personal food choices... again.
